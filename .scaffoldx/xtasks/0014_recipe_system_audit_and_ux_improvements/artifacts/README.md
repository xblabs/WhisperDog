# Artifacts Directory

## Purpose

This directory collects **input materials** that will be used during task execution.

## Current Artifacts

The original plan that spawned this task is preserved at:
- `C:\Users\henry\.claude\plans\cheeky-splashing-rain.md`

## What to Put Here

- UI mockups or wireframes for new UX flows
- Example recipe bundles for testing import/export
- Screenshots of current UI for reference
- User feedback or requirements documents

## Note

Artifacts are **inputs** (what goes in), not outputs. Generated content goes in canonical files (01_prd.md, etc.).
