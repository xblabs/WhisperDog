# Save Point: Card Layout Redesign Needed

## Session Summary

Fixed multiple issues in this session:
1. Manifest file locking on Windows (synchronized save/load)
2. Horizontal button layout (responsive, stacks below 568px)
3. Full transcription storage (.txt files alongside .wav)
4. [more] expansion loads and shows complete text with wrapping

## Pending UX Issue: Card Layout Reorder

### Current Layout
```
Line 1 (bold):  Feb 01, 2026 5:57 PM
Line 2 (small): 41s | 1.5 MB | Mic only
Line 3 (italic): Transcription preview text... [more]
```

### Requested Layout
```
Line 1 (bold):  Transcription text (truncated with ellipsis, or full if short enough)
Line 2 (small): Feb 01, 2026 5:57 PM | 41s | 1.5 MB | Mic only
```

### Changes Required
**File**: `RecordingsPanel.java` - `createRecordingCard()` method

1. Move transcription to first line, make it bold (not italic)
2. Combine date + meta on second line (small, gray)
3. Remove separate transcription preview section
4. Keep [more]/[less] expand functionality on transcription line

### Files Modified This Session
- `RecordingManifest.java` - saveLock, transcriptionFile field
- `RecordingRetentionManager.java` - synchronized methods, .txt storage
- `RecordingsPanel.java` - button layout, text wrapping, truncation

## Resume Instructions
1. Implement card layout reorder per spec above
2. Test truncation/expansion still works
3. Verify responsive behavior maintained
