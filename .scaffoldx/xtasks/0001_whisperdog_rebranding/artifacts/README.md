# Artifacts Directory

## Purpose

This directory collects **input materials** that were used to populate task content via task creation.

## Source Materials

This task was created from the following context:

- `WHISPERDOG_REBRAND_SPEC.md` - Complete rebrand specification (463 lines)
- `UI_ICONS_SPEC.md` - UI icon specifications and padding fixes (128 lines)
- `icons/` - SVG icon assets for UI elements

**Original Location**: `.scaffoldx/xtasks/_brainstorms/rebrand/`

## Workflow

```
1. Collect → Input materials placed in brainstorm directory
2. Create → Task created via `x-task-create --from-context`
3. Execute → Follow checklist and implementation plan
4. Refine → Iterate on implementation as needed
```

## What's Here

- **Requirements**: Comprehensive rebrand specification
- **Technical Specs**: UI icon mapping, padding fixes, code changes
- **Assets**: SVG icon files for menu and buttons
- **Code Examples**: Configuration migration, class renaming, string updates

## Usage

The content from these artifacts has been **preserved** (not summarized) in:
- `01_prd.md` - Full requirements and brand strategy
- `02_implementation_plan.md` - Complete implementation with code examples
- `03_checklist.md` - High-level execution phases

All code blocks, file paths, and configurations from the artifacts are copy-paste ready in the implementation plan.

## Note

Artifacts are **inputs** (what goes in), not outputs. Generated task content is in the canonical files (01_prd.md, 02_implementation_plan.md, 03_checklist.md).
