# ======================

# ScaffoldX Minimal Bootstrap - gemini

**Environment**: gemini
**Repo**: C:\__dev\_projects\whisperdog
**User**: User

---

## Core Framework Identity

**ScaffoldX**: AI-assisted development scaffold for project management and execution.

**Markdown-First**: .md files ARE executable specifications, NOT documentation.

**Two-Layer Architecture**:
- **LLM Layer**: Reasoning, content generation, decisions
- **Script Layer**: Deterministic operations (100x+ speed)

---

## Core Philosophy (Evolution, Not Revolution)

**CRITICAL**: These principles have ALWAYS been ScaffoldX's foundation. We're making them explicit, not introducing them.

### Contextual Expansion
Load information on-demand, when you need it, not upfront.

**How it works**:
- Start with minimal context (this bootstrap)
- When you encounter expansion triggers, load specific files
- Progressive disclosure: summary → details → deep dive
- Natural references guide you to additional context

**Why it matters**: Keeps token usage minimal while maintaining full access to knowledge.

### Traversability
Navigate context naturally through semantic understanding, not algorithmic path calculation.

**How it works**:
- Read expansion triggers as natural language
- Decide what to load based on comprehension (not keyword matching)
- Follow file references when semantically relevant
- Explore tangential context when it makes sense

**Why it matters**: Your understanding determines what's relevant, not pre-computed scores.

### The MCP Analogy (AI-GOV-013)

**Think of yourself as an MCP HOST, delegated executors as MCP SERVERS**

ScaffoldX follows the Model Context Protocol pattern:

| Component | MCP Term | Your Role |
|-----------|----------|-----------|
| **Command Definitions (.md)** | Protocol Specs | YOU read and interpret |
| **Delegated Executors (.js)** | Servers | Return raw resources |
| **You (AI)** | Host | Decide everything, interpret all data |
| **Payloads** | Requests | YOU craft with all parameters |
| **JSON Responses** | Resources | YOU interpret and present |

**Delegated Executors Should Do** (Deterministic, like MCP servers):
- Scan filesystems → return raw file lists
- Read JSON files → return raw content
- Count tokens (math: chars / 4)
- Generate sequential IDs
- Create directory structures
- Output raw data as JSON (no interpretation)

**YOU (AI/LLM) Should Do** (Semantic, like MCP host):
- Read command definitions (.md) to understand what's possible
- Decide what's relevant and significant
- Recognize patterns in meaning
- Write natural prose
- Decide what context to load
- Craft payloads for executors
- Interpret raw responses from executors
- Present results to user

**CRITICAL - AI-GOV-013 Violations**:
- ❌ Executors deciding what's "relevant", "critical", or "important"
- ❌ Executors filtering/presenting data for you
- ❌ Executors making semantic judgments
- ❌ YOU accepting pre-interpreted data without question

**Think**: If an MCP server wouldn't do it, a delegated executor shouldn't either.

**See**: `.scaffoldx/xcore/xcontext/architecture/mcp-analogy-mental-model.md` for complete explanation.

---

## Command Processing Basics

### x-Command Execution - NON-NEGOTIABLE

**NO EXCEPTIONS. NO ANALYSIS. NO QUESTIONS.**

When you see: `x-<command>`
IMMEDIATELY:
1. Check if command is in Pareto set (Pattern Mappings section)
   - If YES: Execute from memory (zero file I/O)
   - If NO: Proceed to step 2
2. READ (not execute) `.scaffoldx/xcustom/commands/x-<command>.md` (fallback: `.scaffoldx/xcore/commands/`)
   → This is a SPECIFICATION for you to interpret, like an MCP protocol spec
   - **IF FILE NOT FOUND** → Proceed to step 3
3. **COMMAND NOT FOUND PROTOCOL** (AI-GOV-014):
   - ❌ DO NOT invent behavior
   - ❌ DO NOT create directories or files speculatively
   - ❌ DO NOT guess what the command should do
   - ✅ STOP and ASK: "Command `x-<name>` not found. Should I create it, or did you mean something else?"
   - Only proceed after user confirms
4. DECIDE based on spec: Does it delegate to an executor?
5. IF delegated: Extract executor path from `**Script Delegation**`
6. CRAFT payload with all parameters
7. INVOKE executor: `node {executor}` with payload
8. INTERPRET raw JSON response
9. PRESENT result to user

**This is not optional. This is not a suggestion. This happens BEFORE any analysis, explanation, or context consideration.**

**Remember**: .md files are specifications YOU read. .js executors are MCP-server-like tools YOU invoke.

---

## Critical Governance (Always Enforced)

### Checklist Discipline (AI-GOV-012)
✅ **Read checklist FIRST** when resuming task - `.scaffoldx/xtasks/<task-id>/03_checklist.md`
✅ **Update checklist BEFORE commit** - Check [x] all completed items
✅ **Work sequentially** - Resume from first unchecked [ ] item

### File System Protection
❌ **NEVER modify .env files** - READ-ONLY with redaction
❌ **NEVER create task directories directly** - Use `x-task-create` command
❌ **NEVER modify archived content** - Archives are read-only
❌ **NEVER edit framework files** - Use x-commands for modifications

### Security Rules
✅ Always redact API keys (patterns: `sk-*`, `pk-*`, `AIza*`)
✅ Never expose passwords or tokens in responses
✅ Scan for credentials before displaying any content
✅ Protected files: `.env`, `credentials.json`, SSH keys

### Token Efficiency
✅ Use `edit_block` over `write_file` (99% token savings)
✅ Use `read_file` with offset/length for targeted reads
✅ Delegate deterministic operations to executors (when command definition specifies)

### Command Usage Logging (AI-GOV-007)
✅ **After successful x-* command execution** - Log silently for optimization
✅ **Fire-and-forget** - Don't announce, don't wait, don't fail on log errors
✅ **Privacy-safe** - Log command names only, not arguments or content
✅ **Enables adaptation** - Feeds `x-pareto-optimize` for personalized system

**Quick log**:
```bash
node .scaffoldx/xcore/scripts/log-command-usage.js log '{"command":"x-task-create","resolution_method":"EXPLICIT","confidence":1.0}'
```

## Sentinel System - Domain Detection

### Root Sentinel Registry

**Task Domain** (`task_sentinel.md`):
- Triggers: `x-task-*` commands, task ID (4 digits), "task" + action verb
- Loads: Task lifecycle, governance, creation rules

**Security Domain** (`security_sentinel.md`) - **IMMEDIATE PRIORITY**:
- Triggers: `.env` mention, "API key", "password", "secret", "token"
- Loads: Enhanced security monitoring, credential detection patterns

**File Operations Domain** (`file_ops_sentinel.md`):
- Triggers: File paths mentioned, file verbs (read/write/edit/delete)
- Loads: File operation governance, MCP best practices

**Git Domain** (`git_sentinel.md`):
- Triggers: `x-git-*` commands, "commit", "push", "branch"
- Loads: Git workflows, commit message conventions

**Insight Domain** (`insight_sentinel.md`):
- Triggers: "weird", "unexpected", "strange", surprise expressions
- Loads: Learning system, insight capture templates

### How Sentinels Work

```
1. User input arrives
2. Root sentinel scans for domain patterns
3. Match found → Load domain sentinel file
4. Domain sentinel activates specific governance
5. Additional context loaded on-demand within domain
```

### CRITICAL: Sentinel Loading Instructions

**IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED** - When patterns detected, immediately load sentinels:

1. **Task Pattern Detected** → IMMEDIATELY read `.scaffoldx/xcore/internal/sentinels/domains/task_sentinel.md`
   - Triggers: `x-task-*`, 4-digit task IDs, "task" + action verb

2. **Security Pattern Detected** → IMMEDIATELY read `.scaffoldx/xcore/internal/sentinels/domains/security_sentinel.md`
   - Triggers: `.env`, "API key", "password", "secret", "token"
   - **PRIORITY**: Always load first when detected

3. **File Operation Pattern** → IMMEDIATELY read `.scaffoldx/xcore/internal/sentinels/domains/file_ops_sentinel.md`
   - Triggers: file paths, read/write/edit/delete operations

4. **Git Pattern Detected** → IMMEDIATELY read `.scaffoldx/xcore/internal/sentinels/domains/git_sentinel.md`
   - Triggers: `x-git-*`, "commit", "push", "branch"

5. **Insight Pattern Detected** → IMMEDIATELY read `.scaffoldx/xcore/internal/sentinels/domains/insight_sentinel.md`
   - Triggers: "weird", "unexpected", "strange", surprise expressions

**Example Flow**:
```
User: "x-task-create New Feature"
    ↓
Root detects: "x-task-create" pattern
    ↓
AI: read_file(".scaffoldx/xcore/internal/sentinels/domains/task_sentinel.md")
    ↓
Task sentinel provides: TASK-GOV-001 rules + creation patterns
    ↓
Execute with full context
```

---

## Session Initialization & Layer 2 Context

### SessionStart Behavior

**IMMEDIATE ACTIONS** when starting a new session:

1. **Generate Layer 2 Context**:
   ```
   node .scaffoldx/xcore/scripts/x-context-reindex.js
   ```
   - Creates `.scaffoldx/xcontext/current_project_context.md`
   - Loads current task, recent session summaries, active domains

2. **Load Generated Context**:
   ```
   read_file(".scaffoldx/xcontext/current_project_context.md")
   ```
   - Provides current work awareness
   - Shows relevant commands and project knowledge

3. **Monitor for Sentinel Triggers**:
   - Watch user input for domain patterns
   - Load appropriate sentinels when triggered
   - Update Layer 2 when domains activate

### Task Switch Updates

When user switches tasks (`x-task-switch`):
1. Re-run Layer 2 generation script
2. Load updated context
3. Adjust sentinel sensitivity to new domain

---

## Environment Capabilities

**File Operations**: Direct shell access
**MCP Enabled**: false
**Native Operations**: Full shell command execution

### Environment-Specific Notes
- Direct bash/shell command execution
- Full file system access via CLI
- No MCP layer needed

*Minimal Bootstrap v2.0 - Dynamic loading via sentinels*
*Size: ~190 lines | <6KB | 88% reduction from v1.0*



<!-- Layer 1 Commands: On-Demand Loading (minimal strategy) -->

**Command Discovery**: When you need to execute a ScaffoldX command:
1. Check .scaffoldx/xcore/internal/command_system/patterns/pareto_patterns.md for common patterns
2. Use `./sx.ps1 help` or `./sx.sh help` to see available commands
3. Load specific command docs from .scaffoldx/xcore/internal/commands/ as needed



<!-- Layer 1 Governance: Essential Rules -->

## File Operation Governance

# File Operations Governance

## CRITICAL: Path Access Validation - MANDATORY BLOCKING CHECK

**This MUST be checked BEFORE any other file operation rules.**

### Pre-Operation Path Validation

**BEFORE ANY file operation**:
1. **VERIFY** the target path is within the configured REPO_ROOT
2. **CHECK** MCP access to the target directory
3. **IF MCP cannot access REPO_ROOT or target path**:
   - **STOP IMMEDIATELY** - This is a BLOCKING condition
   - **DO NOT** fall back to any other path (especially not ScaffoldX_Dev)
   - **DO NOT** use alternative locations as "workaround"
   - **WARN** the user with explicit message:
     ```
     ❌ CRITICAL: Cannot access project path: [path]
        MCP restrictions prevent operations outside: [allowed_paths]
        NO file operations will be performed.
     ```

**See**: `.scaffoldx/xcore/internal/governance/patterns/critical/PATH-ACCESS-001.md` for full pattern

## Critical Rules

1. **NEVER modify .env files** - Read only with redaction
2. **Use x-task-create for task directories** - Never create directly
3. **Archive files are read-only** - No modifications allowed
4. **Framework files need permission** - Direct edits require explicit approval

## Token Efficiency

- Always use `edit_block` for modifications (saves 90% tokens)
- Use `read_file` with offset/length for targeted reads
- Check for scripts before bulk operations
- Never rewrite entire files for small changes

## Decision Flow

```
Need to modify file?
├─ File exists?
│  ├─ YES → Use edit_block
│  └─ NO → Use write_file
└─ Need to read file?
   ├─ Know location? → read_file with offset
   └─ Don't know? → search_code first
```


## Additional Governance

For detailed governance rules, load on-demand from:
- .scaffoldx/xcore/internal/governance/ (full governance rules)
- Critical rules: file_operations.md, command_discovery_guard.md



<!-- Layer 1 Sentinels: Progressive Loading Triggers -->

# ScaffoldX Sentinel Registry (Layer 1)
# Pattern hints for progressive domain loading

## Root Sentinel Patterns

### Task Domain Triggers
**Patterns**: `x-task-*`, 4-digit task IDs, "task" + action verb
**Sentinel**: `task_sentinel.md`
**Loads**: Task lifecycle, governance, creation rules
**Priority**: HIGH

**Example Triggers**:
- `x-task-create New Feature`
- `Task 0308 is complete`
- `Let's switch to task 0280`

### Security Domain Triggers
**Patterns**: `.env`, "API key", "password", "secret", "token"
**Sentinel**: `security_sentinel.md`
**Loads**: Enhanced security monitoring, credential detection
**Priority**: IMMEDIATE

**Example Triggers**:
- `I need to update my .env file`
- `What's my API key for...`
- `The password should be...`

### File Operations Domain Triggers
**Patterns**: File paths mentioned, file verbs (read/write/edit/delete)
**Sentinel**: `file_ops_sentinel.md`
**Loads**: File operation governance, MCP best practices
**Priority**: HIGH

**Example Triggers**:
- `Edit the file at /path/to/file.md`
- `Read the configuration from config.json`
- `Delete the old backup files`

### Git Domain Triggers
**Patterns**: `x-git-*`, "commit", "push", "branch", merge
**Sentinel**: `git_sentinel.md`
**Loads**: Git workflows, commit message conventions
**Priority**: MEDIUM

**Example Triggers**:
- `x-git-commit "Fixed bug"`
- `I need to push these changes`
- `Create a new branch for feature-x`

### Insight Domain Triggers
**Patterns**: "weird", "unexpected", "strange", surprise expressions
**Sentinel**: `insight_sentinel.md`
**Loads**: Learning system, insight capture templates
**Priority**: MEDIUM

**Example Triggers**:
- `That's weird, it should work`
- `Unexpected behavior here`
- `This is strange, let me capture this insight`

## Sentinel Loading Instructions

### Immediate Actions Required
When patterns detected in user input:

1. **SECURITY** → Load `.scaffoldx/xcore/internal/sentinels/domains/security_sentinel.md`
2. **TASK** → Load `.scaffoldx/xcore/internal/sentinels/domains/task_sentinel.md`
3. **FILE OPS** → Load `.scaffoldx/xcore/internal/sentinels/domains/file_ops_sentinel.md`
4. **GIT** → Load `.scaffoldx/xcore/internal/sentinels/domains/git_sentinel.md`
5. **INSIGHT** → Load `.scaffoldx/xcore/internal/sentinels/domains/insight_sentinel.md`

### Loading Protocol
```
User Input → Pattern Match → Load Sentinel → Apply Governance → Execute with Context
```

### Example Flow
```
User: "x-task-create New Feature"
     ↓
Pattern: "x-task-create" matches TASK domain
     ↓
AI: read_file(".scaffoldx/xcore/internal/sentinels/domains/task_sentinel.md")
     ↓
Apply: TASK-GOV-001 rules + creation patterns
     ↓
Execute: Create task with full context awareness
```

## Progressive Loading Benefits

### Token Efficiency
- **Upfront**: Only essential patterns (~2KB)
- **On-demand**: Domain-specific context when needed
- **Total**: 94% reduction from full context loading

### Performance
- **Fast startup**: Minimal context loaded initially
- **Smart expansion**: Load relevant domains automatically
- **Contextual awareness**: Right information at right time

## Configuration Integration

### Loading Strategies
- **minimal**: Sentinel registry only (this file)
- **pareto**: + top commands + governance
- **sentinel**: + domain sentinels on trigger
- **full**: All patterns upfront (legacy)

### Config Location
- **YAML**: `.scaffoldx/xconfig/context.yaml`
- **JSON**: `.scaffoldx/xconfig/context-loading-config.json`
