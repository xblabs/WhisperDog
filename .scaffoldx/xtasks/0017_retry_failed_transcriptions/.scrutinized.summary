## Run: 2026-02-17T21:56:18.5958107+00:00
**Mode**: task + fit-check
**Corpus Version**: 0017
**Verdict**: NEEDS_REVISION (14.3/25 avg)
**Fit**: DRIFT (76%)
**Key Findings**:
- Specification corpus is actionable but not repository-complete.
- Part B premise/scope conflicts with current recording architecture.
- Integration points need explicit file+method contracts.

## Run: 2026-02-17T22:19:26.252Z
**Mode**: task (deep audit) + fit-check
**Corpus Version**: 0017 (unchanged since Run 1)
**Verdict**: NEEDS_REVISION (11.0/25 avg, down from 14.3)
**Fit**: DRIFT (61%, down from 76%)
**Key Findings**:
- **CRITICAL**: Part B premise is factually wrong. Mic path already streams to disk (`AudioRecorder.java:44`). Memory buffering exists only in system audio (`SystemAudioCapture.java:320,388`).
- **CRITICAL**: Scope deadlock. Part B targets memory buffering, out-of-scope excludes dual-source, but memory buffering IS the dual-source path.
- Pipeline entry point for recovery flow is ambiguous (3 candidates, each with different preconditions).
- No verification steps, regression tests, or rollback criteria in checklist.
- 0/8 drift items resolved since Run 1 (4 new items added).
**Files**: 0/5 delivered | **Checklist**: 0/23 | **ACs**: 0/0
**Drift Items**: 8 total (3 unresolved from Run 1, 5 new)

## Run: 2026-02-18T11:24:31.882Z
**Mode**: verify-implementation + fit-check
**Corpus Version**: 0017
**Verdict**: PARTIAL (88.31%)
**Fit**: FIT (98.50%)
**Key Findings**:
- All 6 planned implementation files are present and modified as expected.
- Checklist verification is 23/25 for completed items (2 partial: explicit FlatLaf theming proof and outdated hotkey-init wording).
- Plan adherence is 75.00% due to supporting but undocumented changes (`RecorderForm.java`) and checklist updates.
- Build verification passed: `mvn package -DskipTests` reported BUILD SUCCESS at 2026-02-18T11:21:34Z.
**Files**: 6/6 | **Checklist**: 23/25 (2 partial) | **ACs**: n/a
