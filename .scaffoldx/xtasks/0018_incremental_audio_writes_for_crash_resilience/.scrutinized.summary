## Run: 2026-02-18T10:18:14Z
**Mode**: Task (specification audit) + Fit Check
**Corpus Version**: Initial draft
**Verdict**: PASS (post-fix) (92%)
**Fit**: FIT (97%)
**Key Findings**:
- CRITICAL: Implementation plan had wrong file paths for SystemAudioCapture.java and AudioCaptureManager.java (said `recording` package, actually `audio` package) - FIXED
- MEDIUM: PRD sample rate contradiction between meta ("16kHz") and constraints ("44100/48000 Hz") - FIXED
- MEDIUM: Missing failure modes in PRD (disk full, writer init failure, stop() before init) - FIXED
- LOW: Line number reference off by 2 in PRD and checklist (320 -> 322) - FIXED
- LOW: Windows-specific kill command in checklist - FIXED
- Cross-package import added to plan (SystemAudioCapture imports from recording package)
**Files**: 3/3 audited | **Initial Scores**: 19, 17, 21 | **Final Scores**: 23, 23, 23

## Run: 2026-02-18T10:33:23Z
**Mode**: Task (specification audit) + Fit Check
**Corpus Version**: Updated in-place during audit
**Verdict**: PASS (24/25 average)
**Fit**: FIT (96%)
**Key Findings**:
- PRD init-failure branch was non-deterministic; fixed to deterministic fail-fast behavior.
- Implementation plan sample-rate guidance was mismatched; corrected to post-conversion guidance.
- Checklist action items now use explicit repository paths.
- No fit drift detected: task is current, references resolve, no parallel implementation found.
**Files**: 3/3 audited | **Initial Scores**: 24, 24, 24 | **Final Scores**: 24, 24, 24
