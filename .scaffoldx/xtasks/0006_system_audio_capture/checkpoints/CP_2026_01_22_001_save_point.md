# Task 0006 Checkpoint: Cluster 1 Complete

## Work Completed
- Researched WASAPI loopback capture (Microsoft docs, XT-Audio library)
- Upgraded project from Java 11 to Java 17
- Added XT-Audio 2.0 dependency to pom.xml
- Created SystemAudioCapture class with WASAPI integration
- Implemented: isAvailable(), listLoopbackDevices(), start(), stop()
- Created DualCaptureTest for simultaneous mic + system audio
- All tests passing: loopback detection, 10s capture, format compatibility, dual capture

## Current State
- Cluster 1: Platform Research & Feasibility - COMPLETE (6/6 items)
- Cluster 2: Dual-Track Capture Infrastructure - IN PROGRESS (3/7 items)
- Git commit: 49bc590

## Key Files
- pom.xml (Java 17 + XT-Audio 2.0)
- src/main/java/org/whisperdog/audio/SystemAudioCapture.java
- src/main/java/org/whisperdog/audio/DualCaptureTest.java
- .scaffoldx/xtasks/0006_system_audio_capture/artifacts/01_research_findings.md

## Next Steps
1. Create AudioCaptureManager to coordinate mic + system
2. Implement synchronized start with common timestamp
3. Add temp file management for system audio track

## Resume Command
