## Run: 2026-02-18T10:18:14Z
**Mode**: Task (specification audit) + Fit Check
**Corpus Version**: Initial draft
**Verdict**: PASS (post-fix) (92%)
**Fit**: FIT (97%)
**Key Findings**:
- CRITICAL: Implementation plan had wrong file paths for SystemAudioCapture.java and AudioCaptureManager.java (said `recording` package, actually `audio` package) - FIXED
- MEDIUM: PRD sample rate contradiction between meta ("16kHz") and constraints ("44100/48000 Hz") - FIXED
- MEDIUM: Missing failure modes in PRD (disk full, writer init failure, stop() before init) - FIXED
- LOW: Line number reference off by 2 in PRD and checklist (320 -> 322) - FIXED
- LOW: Windows-specific kill command in checklist - FIXED
- Cross-package import added to plan (SystemAudioCapture imports from recording package)
**Files**: 3/3 audited | **Initial Scores**: 19, 17, 21 | **Final Scores**: 23, 23, 23

## Run: 2026-02-18T10:33:23Z
**Mode**: Task (specification audit) + Fit Check
**Corpus Version**: Updated in-place during audit
**Verdict**: PASS (24/25 average)
**Fit**: FIT (96%)
**Key Findings**:
- PRD init-failure branch was non-deterministic; fixed to deterministic fail-fast behavior.
- Implementation plan sample-rate guidance was mismatched; corrected to post-conversion guidance.
- Checklist action items now use explicit repository paths.
- No fit drift detected: task is current, references resolve, no parallel implementation found.
**Files**: 3/3 audited | **Initial Scores**: 24, 24, 24 | **Final Scores**: 24, 24, 24

## Run: 2026-02-18T12:15:00Z
**Mode**: Verify Implementation
**Corpus Version**: Post-implementation (Phases 1-3 code complete, uncommitted)
**Verdict**: FAIL (45%)
**Fit**: N/A (post-implementation verification)
**Key Findings**:
- File Coverage 100%: all 3 required planned files delivered
- HIGH: Checklist 0/31 marked done despite 13/15 code items implemented
- MEDIUM: Zero implementation commits - all work in uncommitted working tree
- Positive deviation: writer init in start() instead of callback (fail-fast)
- 3 unplanned test files (justified API adaptations)
- Phases 4-5 (crash validation, regression) not executed
- Build passes: mvn compile, test, package all green
**Files**: 3/3 delivered | **Checklist**: 0/31 marked | **Code verified**: 13/15
