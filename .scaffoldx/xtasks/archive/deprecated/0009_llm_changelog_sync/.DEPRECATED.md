# DEPRECATED

**Reason**: Superseded by ScaffoldX core task 0358_llm_changelog_sync - canonical spec lives in ScaffoldX_Dev repo

**Deprecated Date**: 2026-01-31
**Deprecated By**: Henry

**Alternative Solution**: `C:\__dev\_projects\ScaffoldX_Dev\.scaffoldx\xtasks\0358_llm_changelog_sync`

---

This task has been deprecated and archived. It should not be activated or worked on.

## Context

Task 0009 was the origin of the LLM-driven changelog sync feature, discovered during a WhisperDog documentation audit on 2026-01-25. The feature was subsequently ported to ScaffoldX core as task 0358, which contains the complete and canonical specification including:

- Commit grouping algorithm (section 3.2)
- Deduplication rules (section 3.3)
- Edge case handling (section 4.3)
- Configuration schema (section 4.4)

WhisperDog serves as validation ground but the implementation spec lives in ScaffoldX.
