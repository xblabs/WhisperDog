## Completed Work

### [1] ISS_00001 - File Size Validation ✅

**Back-reference**: `x-issue-start 00001` → `.scaffoldx/xissues/active/0001-0300/ISS_00001_file_size_validation.md`
**Related Task**: Blocks Task 0002 (Error Handling)
**Code Location**: `OpenAITranscribeClient.java:193-204`

**What was done**:
- Added `MAX_COMPRESSED_FILE_SIZE` constant (26MB)
- Added validation after compression, before API call
- Throws IOException with user-friendly message
- Logs error with file details

**To test**:
- [ ] Build: `mvn package`
- [ ] Record long audio (45+ min to exceed 26MB after compression)
- [ ] Verify error: `"Compressed file is X.XX MB, exceeds 26MB limit"`
- [ ] Verify NO API call made

**Test result**:

### [2] ISS_00002 - Dropdown Resets on Hotkey ✅

**Back-reference**: `x-issue-start 00002` → `.scaffoldx/xissues/resolved/2025-12/ISS_00002_...`
**Related Task**: Task 0004 (UI/UX)
**Code Location**: `RecorderForm.java:86, 254-256, 970-997`

**What was done**:

- Added `isPopulatingComboBox` flag (line 86)
- ItemListener now ignores events when flag is true (lines 254-256)
- `populatePostProcessingComboBox()` sets flag before repopulating, clears in finally (lines 970-997)

**Root cause**: When `addItem()` auto-selects the first item during repopulation, the ItemListener fired and corrupted the saved UUID in config. This caused the NEXT repopulation to restore the wrong pipeline.

**To test**:
- [ ] Build: `mvn package`
- [ ] Select Pipeline B (not the first one)
- [ ] Press hotkey → record briefly → stop
- [ ] Verify dropdown still shows Pipeline B
- [ ] Navigate away (Settings) and back → verify Pipeline B still selected
- [ ] Close/reopen app → verify Pipeline B persists

**Test result**:

### [3] ISS_00003 - Pipeline Button Disabled After Recording ✅

**Back-reference**: `x-issue-start 00003` → `.scaffoldx/xissues/active/0001-0300/ISS_00003_pipeline_button_disabled.md`
**Related Task**: Task 0004 (UI/UX)
**Code Location**: `RecorderForm.java:1001-1002`

**What was done**:

- Added explicit `updateRunPipelineButtonState()` call after `populatePostProcessingComboBox()` completes
- The `isPopulatingComboBox` flag was blocking ItemListener events, preventing button state refresh
- Fix ensures button state is always updated after dropdown repopulation

**Root cause**: The `isPopulatingComboBox` flag (added for ISS_00002) blocked the ItemListener from calling `updateRunPipelineButtonState()`. After dropdown repopulation, the button state wasn't updated, leaving it disabled even when transcription was available.

**To test**:

- [ ] Build: `mvn package`
- [ ] Record audio → Stop recording
- [ ] Verify "Run Pipeline" button is enabled after transcription completes
- [ ] Navigate away (Settings) and back → verify button state correct
- [ ] Record again → verify button enables after transcription
- [ ] Verify no need to toggle dropdown to enable button

**Test result**:

### [4] ISS_00004 - Large Recording Warning Prompt ✅

**Back-reference**: `x-issue-start 00004` → `.scaffoldx/xissues/active/0001-0300/ISS_00004_large_recording_prompt.md`
**Related Task**: Task 0002 (Error Handling)
**Code Location**: `SilenceRemover.java:28-61, 238-340` | `RecorderForm.java:1203-1244` | `LargeRecordingWarningDialog.java` (new)

**What was done**:

- Added `SilenceAnalysisResult` class with duration, silence ratio, and threshold checking
- Added `analyzeForSilence()` method for pre-flight analysis without processing
- Created `LargeRecordingWarningDialog` with metrics display and Transcribe/Cancel buttons
- Integrated into `AudioTranscriptionWorker` before silence removal
- Added graceful cancellation handling with user notification

**Root cause**: N/A - New feature implementation

**To test**:

- [ ] Build: `mvn package`
- [ ] Record audio for 10+ minutes with mostly silence (or use a long silent audio file)
- [ ] Stop recording → verify warning dialog appears
- [ ] Check dialog shows: Duration, Silence %, Estimated useful audio
- [ ] Click "Cancel" → verify transcription aborts with "Transcription cancelled" notification
- [ ] Record again → click "Transcribe Anyway" → verify transcription proceeds normally
- [ ] Record short audio (< 10 min) → verify NO dialog appears
- [ ] Record 10+ min audio with < 50% silence → verify NO dialog appears

**Test result**:

### [5] ISS_00005 - Log Line Breaks ✅

**Back-reference**: `x-issue-start 00005` → `.scaffoldx/xissues/active/0001-0300/ISS_00005_log_line_breaks.md`
**Related Task**: Task 0004 (UI/UX)
**Code Location**: `ConsoleLogger.java:60-68` | `RecorderForm.java:700, 816, 1315`

**What was done**:

- Added `logTranscript()` method to ConsoleLogger with blank lines before/after
- Transcript text logged without timestamp prefix for easy selection
- Integrated at all three transcription completion points in RecorderForm

**Root cause**: N/A - Enhancement. Transcript text was not being displayed in the console log at all.

**To test**:

- [ ] Build: `mvn package`
- [ ] Record audio → Stop → Verify transcription appears in console log
- [ ] Check blank line BEFORE transcript text
- [ ] Check blank line AFTER transcript text
- [ ] Verify transcript has NO timestamp prefix (easy triple-click selection)
- [ ] Test chunked transcription (large file) → same formatting
- [ ] Test Faster-Whisper → same formatting

**Test result**:

### [6] ISS_00006 - Min Speech Duration Threshold ✅

**Back-reference**: `x-issue-start 00006` → `.scaffoldx/xissues/active/0001-0300/ISS_00006_min_non_silence_threshold.md`
**Related Task**: Task 0003 (Mic Test Screen - extracted)
**Code Location**: `ConfigManager.java:333-341` | `SettingsForm.java:437-486` | `MinSpeechDurationDialog.java` (new) | `RecorderForm.java:1249-1283`

**What was done**:

- Added `minSpeechDuration` setting to ConfigManager (default: 0.5s)
- Added slider in Settings → Audio (range: 0-2.0 seconds)
- Created MinSpeechDurationDialog with Discard/Transcribe Anyway buttons
- Integrated check after silence analysis, before transcription

**Root cause**: N/A - New feature. Prevents wasted API calls on accidental/noise recordings.

**To test**:

- [ ] Build: `mvn package`
- [ ] Settings → Audio → verify "Min speech duration" slider appears
- [ ] Record < 0.5s of speech → verify warning dialog appears
- [ ] Click "Discard" → verify transcription cancelled
- [ ] Record again → click "Transcribe Anyway" → verify transcription proceeds
- [ ] Record 1+ seconds of speech → verify NO dialog appears
- [ ] Set slider to 0 → verify feature disabled (no dialog ever)

**Test result**:

### [7] ISS_00007 - Sticky Recording Warning ✅

**Back-reference**: `x-issue-start 00007` → `.scaffoldx/xissues/active/0001-0300/ISS_00007_sticky_recording_warning.md`
**Related Task**: Task 0003 (Mic Test Screen - extracted)
**Code Location**: `ConfigManager.java:801-822` | `SettingsForm.java:48, 489-537, 942-952` | `RecorderForm.java:89-93, 110-148, 1056-1158` | `TrayIconManager.java:19, 23, 79-115`

**What was done**:

- Added `recordingWarningDuration` setting to ConfigManager (default: 120s / 2 min)
- Added slider in Settings → Audio (range: 0-10 min, 0 = disabled)
- Added Timer in RecorderForm that checks every 500ms if recording exceeds threshold
- Visual warning: pulsing orange status circle + button text shows elapsed time
- Tray icon updates status text to "⚠ Recording is getting long..."
- Console log shows warning message when threshold exceeded

**Root cause**: N/A - New feature. Reminds users when recording exceeds configured duration to prevent accidentally long recordings.

**To test**:

- [ ] Build: `mvn package`
- [ ] Settings → Audio → verify "Warn after recording" slider appears
- [ ] Set slider to 30 seconds for quick testing
- [ ] Record for 30+ seconds → verify:
  - Status circle pulses orange
  - Button shows elapsed time with ⚠ icon
  - Console log shows warning message
  - Tray icon tooltip changes (if app minimized)
- [ ] Stop recording → verify warning indicator clears
- [ ] Set slider to "Off" (0) → verify no warning appears regardless of duration

**Test result**:

### [8] ISS_00008 - File Type Validation ✅

**Back-reference**: `x-issue-start 00008` → `.scaffoldx/xissues/active/0001-0300/ISS_00008_file_type_validation.md`
**Related Task**: Task 0002 (Error Handling)
**Code Location**: `TranscriptionValidator.java:50-95` | `OpenAITranscribeClient.java:188-196`

**What was done**:

- Added SUPPORTED_EXTENSIONS constant (flac, m4a, mp3, mp4, mpeg, mpga, oga, ogg, wav, webm)
- Added validateFileType() method to check extension before API call
- Added isSupportedFileType() helper for non-throwing validation
- Added getSupportedFormatsDisplay() for user-friendly format list
- Integrated into transcribe() method - fails fast before any processing

**Root cause**: Non-audio files (images, PDFs) sent to OpenAI API returned cryptic HTTP 400 "Could not parse multipart form" errors instead of helpful user messages.

**To test**:

- [ ] Build: `mvn package`
- [ ] Drag/drop a .jpg or .pdf file → verify error dialog shows supported formats
- [ ] Verify NO API call made (check logs)
- [ ] Drag/drop valid .wav or .mp3 → verify transcription proceeds normally

**Test result**:

### [9] ISS_00009 - RMS Window Size Mismatch ✅

**Back-reference**: `x-issue-start 00009` → `.scaffoldx/xissues/active/0001-0300/ISS_00009_rms_window_mismatch.md`
**Related Task**: Task 0003 (Mic Test Screen)
**Code Location**: `AudioAnalyzer.java:81` | `SettingsForm.java:1087`

**What was done**:

- Standardized all RMS analysis to 100ms windows (matching SilenceRemover)
- AudioAnalyzer.java: Changed from 20ms to 100ms windows
- SettingsForm.java: Added rolling buffer for 100ms sample accumulation

**Root cause**: Three different RMS window sizes (20ms, 32ms, 100ms) caused calibration in MicTest to not match actual silence removal behavior. Shorter windows showed more variance, making calibrated thresholds appear to "chop into audio".

**To test**:

- [ ] Build: `mvn package`
- [ ] Open Settings → Audio tab, watch live VU meter
- [ ] Note the RMS values shown for normal speech
- [ ] Open MicTest screen, calibrate threshold with moderate speech
- [ ] Record same speech in main app
- [ ] Verify silence removal matches calibration preview (no unexpected cutting)

**Test result**:

### [10] Task 0004 Phase 3 - ProcessProgressPanel ✅

**Back-reference**: Task 0004 Phase 3 → `.scaffoldx/xtasks/0004_ui_ux_improvements/03_checklist.md`
**Related Task**: Task 0004 (UI/UX Improvements)
**Code Location**: `ui/ProcessProgressPanel.java` | `ui/Spacing.java` | `ui/Icons.java` | `RecorderForm.java`

**What was done**:

- Created Spacing.java - 8px base unit spacing utilities
- Created Icons.java - FlatSVGIcon manager with caching
- Created ProcessProgressPanel.java - Full-featured progress panel:
  - File path display with truncation
