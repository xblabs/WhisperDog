### File 1: 01_prd.md

#### Pre-scan: Axiom Extraction

Stated givens:
1. `SystemAudioCapture.java:322` initializes `ByteArrayOutputStream`
2. Lines 388-390 append converted bytes
3. Lines 555-557 return byte array on `stop()`
4. `AudioCaptureManager.java:157-162` writes WAV from byte array
5. `AudioRecorder.java:44` calls `AudioSystem.write()`
6. System audio: "16kHz mono 16-bit" (meta) vs "system's sample rate (typically 44100 or 48000 Hz)" (constraints)
7. ~19 MB for 10-minute recording

Unstated axioms:
- Where temp files are written (no path specified in PRD)
- What happens if writer initialization fails
- Cross-package relationship between target files

#### 5-Question Audit

| # | Question | Score | Finding |
|---|----------|-------|---------|
| Q1 | WHAT files do I create? | 4/5 | Target files named but `IncrementalWavWriter` has no package/path in PRD. Implementer must look at plan for location. |
| Q2 | WHAT content goes in each? | 3/5 | **CONTRADICTION**: Meta says "16kHz mono 16-bit". Constraints said "at the system's sample rate (typically 44100 or 48000 Hz)". Actual code evidence: `writeWavFile(..., 16000, 1)` uses 16kHz. PRD contradicted itself on the output format of the conversion pipeline. |
| Q3 | WHAT triggers execution? | 5/5 | Clear: writer opened at capture start, each callback writes, stop() finalizes. |
| Q4 | HOW do I know I'm done? | 4/5 | 7 explicit requirements. "Identical results to current behavior" is hard to verify precisely. |
| Q5 | WHAT if X fails? | 3/5 | Crash case documented well. Missing: disk full during write, IOException on writer initialization, temp directory inaccessible, stop() called before writer initialized. |

**Total**: 19/25 (76%)
**Status**: NEEDS_REVISION

#### Ambiguity Flags

| Line | Text | Problem | Fix |
|------|------|---------|-----|
| 9 | "`SystemAudioCapture.java:320`" | Line 320 is a logger call. Actual init is at line 322. | Changed `:320` to `:322` |
| 37 | "output is 16-bit PCM at the system's sample rate (typically 44100 or 48000 Hz)" | Contradicts meta ("16kHz mono 16-bit") and actual code (`writeWavFile(..., 16000, 1)`). After conversion the output is 16kHz, not the system rate. | Rewrote: "output is 16-bit mono PCM at 16kHz (resampled from the system's native rate)" |
| 33 | "header reflects last-written sizes" | Incomplete. What if zero bytes were written before crash? | Added: "If crash occurs before first write, the file contains only the 44-byte header with Subchunk2Size=0 (empty but valid WAV)." |

#### Contradiction Detection (Cross-check)

| Statement A | Statement B | Conflict |
|-------------|-------------|----------|
| Meta: "16kHz mono 16-bit" | Constraints: "system's sample rate (typically 44100 or 48000 Hz)" | Direct contradiction on sample rate after conversion |

#### QED Gate

FAIL (pre-fix) - An implementer reading only the PRD constraints section would initialize `IncrementalWavWriter` with 44100 or 48000 Hz instead of 16000 Hz.

#### Fixes Applied
1. Line reference 320 -> 322 for ByteArrayOutputStream init
2. Constraints section: rewritten sample rate description to match actual behavior (16kHz post-conversion)
3. Added crash-before-first-write edge case to behavior spec
4. Added failure modes section: disk full, writer init failure, stop() before init

**Revised Score**: 23/25 (92%)

### File 2: 02_implementation_plan.md

#### Pre-scan: Axiom Extraction

Stated givens:
1. `SystemAudioCapture.java` at `src/main/java/org/whisperdog/recording/SystemAudioCapture.java`
2. `AudioCaptureManager.java` at `src/main/java/org/whisperdog/recording/AudioCaptureManager.java`
3. `AudioRecorder.java` at `src/main/java/org/whisperdog/recording/AudioRecorder.java`
4. `IncrementalWavWriter.java` at `src/main/java/org/whisperdog/recording/IncrementalWavWriter.java`

**CRITICAL**: Axioms 1 and 2 are FALSE.
- SystemAudioCapture.java is at `src/main/java/org/whisperdog/audio/SystemAudioCapture.java`
- AudioCaptureManager.java is at `src/main/java/org/whisperdog/audio/AudioCaptureManager.java`

Both files are in the `org.whisperdog.audio` package, not `org.whisperdog.recording`.

#### 5-Question Audit

| # | Question | Score | Finding |
|---|----------|-------|---------|
| Q1 | WHAT files do I create? | 2/5 | **WRONG PATHS**: SystemAudioCapture.java and AudioCaptureManager.java paths specify `org.whisperdog.recording` but both files are in `org.whisperdog.audio`. An LLM executing cold would fail to locate these files. |
| Q2 | WHAT content goes in each? | 5/5 | Excellent detail. Full API signature for IncrementalWavWriter, WAV header layout table, write cycle pseudocode, specific line-by-line changes for each modified file. |
| Q3 | WHAT triggers execution? | 4/5 | Writer initialization timing described ("after WASAPI format negotiation") but exact code location not pinpointed. |
| Q4 | HOW do I know I'm done? | 3/5 | Files Summary table is clear but no verification steps in the plan itself. Relies on checklist for all verification. |
| Q5 | WHAT if X fails? | 3/5 | Error handling for audio callback is good (log, flag, don't throw). Missing: writer initialization failure, stop() when writer is null, RandomAccessFile seek failure. |

**Total**: 17/25 (68%)
**Status**: NEEDS_REVISION

#### Ambiguity Flags

| Line | Text | Problem | Fix |
|------|------|---------|-----|
| 77 | "`src/.../recording/SystemAudioCapture.java`" | Wrong package. File is in `org.whisperdog.audio`. | Changed to `src/.../audio/SystemAudioCapture.java` |
| 98 | "`src/.../recording/AudioCaptureManager.java`" | Wrong package. File is in `org.whisperdog.audio`. | Changed to `src/.../audio/AudioCaptureManager.java` |
| 88 | "Must happen after WASAPI format negotiation" | Where in the code flow? What method? What line? | Added: "Initialize in the first invocation of the audio callback (around lines 380-390), guarded by a null check on the writer field." |
| - | (missing) | No mention of cross-package import: SystemAudioCapture (audio pkg) must import IncrementalWavWriter (recording pkg). | Added import note. |

#### Contradiction Detection (Cross-check)

| Statement A | Statement B | Conflict |
|-------------|-------------|----------|
| Plan: "File: .../recording/SystemAudioCapture.java" | Codebase: file at .../audio/SystemAudioCapture.java | Wrong package |
| Plan: "File: .../recording/AudioCaptureManager.java" | Codebase: file at .../audio/AudioCaptureManager.java | Wrong package |

#### QED Gate

FAIL (pre-fix) - An LLM executing cold would search for SystemAudioCapture.java in the `recording` package, fail to find it, and either error out or create a new file in the wrong location.

#### Fixes Applied
1. Corrected SystemAudioCapture.java path to `org.whisperdog.audio`
2. Corrected AudioCaptureManager.java path to `org.whisperdog.audio`
3. Updated Files Summary table with correct paths
4. Added cross-package import note (`import org.whisperdog.recording.IncrementalWavWriter`)
5. Added writer initialization location guidance (first callback invocation, null check)

**Revised Score**: 23/25 (92%)

### File 3: 03_checklist.md

#### Pre-scan: Axiom Extraction

Stated givens:
1. Writer file pattern: `whisperdog_system_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.wav`
2. Temp directory: `ConfigManager.getTempDirectory()`
3. Phase sequence: IncrementalWavWriter -> SystemAudioCapture -> AudioCaptureManager -> crash test -> regression
4. Verify steps with specific test criteria

Unstated axioms:
- What audio player to use for verification (implied: any)
- How to force-kill JVM on Windows specifically

#### 5-Question Audit

| # | Question | Score | Finding |
|---|----------|-------|---------|
| Q1 | WHAT files do I create? | 4/5 | References files by name (acceptable, as plan provides paths). |
| Q2 | WHAT content goes in each? | 4/5 | Specific constructor args, method names, verification criteria. |
| Q3 | WHAT triggers execution? | 5/5 | Phases are sequential, items within phases are sequential. Clear ordering. |
| Q4 | HOW do I know I'm done? | 5/5 | Every phase has a **Verify** step with concrete test criteria. Phase 4 includes force-kill test. Phase 5 has 6 regression items. |
| Q5 | WHAT if X fails? | 3/5 | No explicit recovery paths. What if Phase 1 verify fails? What if build fails in Phase 5? |

**Total**: 21/25 (84%)
**Status**: NEEDS_REVISION (minor)

#### Ambiguity Flags

| Line | Text | Problem | Fix |
|------|------|---------|-----|
| 14 | "line 320" | Same line number error as PRD. Actual init is at line 322. | Changed to "field at line 45, init at line 322" |
| 30 | "force-kill JVM (`kill -9` or Task Manager)" | On Windows, `kill -9` requires Unix-like environment. | Changed to: "Task Manager 'End Process' or `taskkill /F /PID <pid>` on Windows" |
| 15 | "Writer file placed in `ConfigManager.getTempDirectory()`" | This detail is ONLY in the checklist, not in PRD or plan. | Flagged for plan addition (not checklist issue). |

#### QED Gate

PASS (conditional) - Checklist is executable with plan context. Missing recovery paths are a minor gap.

#### Fixes Applied
1. Line reference updated to "field at line 45, init at line 322"
2. Updated force-kill instructions for Windows

### Fit Check

**Persona**: Dr. Elaine Moretti (Archaeologist)
**Task Age**: 0 tasks since creation (0 months)
**Risk Level**: LOW

| Factor | Score | Evidence |
|--------|-------|----------|
| Task age | 100% | Task 0018 is the newest task (ID 18 of 18). Created 2026-02-18. Zero drift. |
| Target file drift | 100% | 0 commits touching SystemAudioCapture.java, AudioCaptureManager.java, or AudioRecorder.java since task creation. |
| Component existence | 100% | All 3 target files exist. `ByteArrayOutputStream capturedAudio` field verified at line 45. `writeWavFile()` method verified at lines 304-329. `AudioSystem.write()` verified at line 45 of AudioRecorder.java. |
| Governance alignment | 100% | No AI-GOV conflicts. Task targets `/src/` code (traditional implementation per AI-GOV-008 rule 2). |
| Import/usage | 80% | Plan specifies consumers (SystemAudioCapture, optionally AudioRecorder) for IncrementalWavWriter. Cross-package import now documented. Downstream consumers (SilenceRemover, ChunkedTranscriptionWorker) already accept `File` type. |
| Parallel impl absence | 100% | No existing IncrementalWavWriter, WavWriter, or incremental WAV writing utility. `AudioFileAnalyzer` uses `RandomAccessFile` for reading (precedent for the pattern) but serves a different purpose. |
| Merge safety | 100% | No deprecated patterns reintroduced. `RandomAccessFile` is established in codebase. `synchronized` blocks already used in SystemAudioCapture for thread safety. |

**Danger Signals**:
- None detected.

**Fit Score**: 97%
**Verdict**: FIT
**Summary**: Task 0018 is brand new, precisely targeted, and fully aligned with the current codebase. All target files exist at their expected locations with the expected content. The IncrementalWavWriter has no parallel implementation. Downstream consumers already work with `File` references.
