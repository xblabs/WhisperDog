# Save Point: Task 0015 Bug Fixes

## Session Context
Continuing bug fix mode for Recordings Panel UX improvements.

## Completed Fixes (This Session)
1. **Top padding**: Changed from 24px to 48px
2. **Refresh sync bug**: Added `firstRun` flag - calls `reloadManifest()` on first panel access to sync with filesystem
3. **Card bottom padding**: Changed to 12px (was 10px)
4. **Ellipsis/more link**: Fixed to show `[more]` for pre-truncated text (ends with `...`) + uses fixed 60 char display length
5. **Play/Stop icons**: Reduced from 14px to 10px (30% smaller) - Delete icon unchanged at 14px

## Files Modified
- `RecordingsPanel.java`: Padding, firstRun flag, icon sizes, ellipsis fix
- `InlineAudioPlayer.java`: Icon size constant
- `RecordingManifest.java`: `scanAndReconcile()` method
- `RecordingRetentionManager.java`: Updated `reloadManifest()` to call reconcile

## Current State
- Build compiles successfully
- Awaiting user verification of all fixes
- 33 recordings should now load on first panel access

## Resume Instructions
1. User should restart app and verify fixes
2. Check: recordings load on first access
3. Check: `[more]` link appears on truncated text
4. Check: Play icon is smaller than Delete icon
5. Continue with any remaining issues reported
